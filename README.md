# warviz

## Development

To serve the app locally and automatically recompile whenever code changes:

```bash
yarn dev
```

To run the tests once:

```bash
yarn test
```

To automatically run tests every time code changes:

```bash
yarn test:watch
```

## TODO

* Allow inputting player names / enforce a limit
* [Generative music](./MUSIC_PLAN.md)
* Nicer display of players' cards - bigger font, table
* Draw attention to the higher card somehow
  * e.g. make the higher card green and the lower card red
